My entry for the job.

# Installation
Clone this repo

First you need to fire up the backend:
1. `cd backend`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

You need to have a spare port on 8080.

Then you just need to start up the frontend:
1. `cd frontend`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

The frontend connects to the 3000 port. Maybe you need to add `127.0.0.1 localhost` to your host file.

If you have any problems with the code or you have a question, just email me. :)

Thanks,
